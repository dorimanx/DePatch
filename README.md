Plugin DePatch was created to fix game issues, add more features, and stop people from exploiting things. 

Plugin is Open Source.
https://github.com/dorimanx/DePatch/commits/master

Feel free to change and send pull requests or just ping me and i will merge your changes.

I am working on adding more things as we "invent" them or merge other open source code and adapting to our servers need.

"We" are the Prometheus Servers. PVE/PVP/NPC
https://space-engineers.com/server/124400/

If you like to see some more functions, and have ideas, we can think if that can be implemented and will not conflict with existing plugins.

Plugin can be downloaded at torch plugins site or via torch server app.
