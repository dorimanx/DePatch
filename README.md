Plugin DePatch was created to fix game issues, stop people from doing wrong things, and drop server simulation for all others.
Main Developer of plugin is @LTP We had ideas, he created the code. 
Later i have took over maintanance and development.

Plugin is Open Source.

Feel free to change and send pull requests or just ping me and i will merge your changes.

I am working on adding more things as we "invent" them or merge other open source code and adapting to our servers need.

"We" are the Prometheus Servers. PVE/PVP/NPC/ADV Vanilla.

If you like to see some more functions, and have ideas, we can think if that can be implemented and will not conflict with existing plugins.
